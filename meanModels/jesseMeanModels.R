# Set-Up

# I used the beginning sections of each code file to pull together
#   data set up files that can be sourced into this one for cleaner
#   reading. See the sourced files to make changes to data cleaning
#   procedure.

# For this model, I started with the three-way interaction of treatment,
#    temp, and dpi and then removed higher level interactions sequentially
#    when they were not significant. The final result only had one two-way
#    interaction in it. I chose the inverse link over the log link based
#    on BIC metrics. There is some evidence of heteroscedasticity in the
#    DHARMa residuals, but the model we have is the best one I could figure.
#    I think it has to do with how small the values are and the fact that 
#    we don't have a ton of data. I may think about this more later, but
#    I am comfortable that the results are reasonable given the data.
