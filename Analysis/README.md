Repo for Temperature and Immunity Fall 2022 Project

##DATA##
---------------------------------
Named Temperature + Immunity Fall 2022, these data were generated by Jesse Garrett-Larsen between August and December 2022. 
Wild-caught House Finches (n=48) were kept in thermoneutral (22-27C) and subthermoneutral (4-9C) environmental chambers. 
Half of the birds from each room were infected with 7.5E2 CCU/mL of NC2006.080-5 Mycoplasma gallisepticum. 
Birds were sampled over the course of infection. See temp_immunity_data_dictionary.csv for variable descriptions.
